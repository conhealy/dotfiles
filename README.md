# Con's dotfiles

My fairly sparse dotfiles. It's mostly just a vimrc.

Stuff here is mostly taken from other dotfiles found on github.

Vundle and Pathogen should already be installed for the vimrc to work
Once these are installed, run the installDots.sh script to install pathogen
plugins. Then create symlinks to your actual bashrc and vimrc files.

I will make the intall script more complete when I have to install this on a
new computer.
